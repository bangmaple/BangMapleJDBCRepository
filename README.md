# BangMapleJDBCRepository
Inspired by the JpaRepository of Spring framework which also provides many capabilities for the operations like CRUD, Pagination and Sorting.

---------------
## üõ† Features:

- CRUD Operations.
- Paging operations.
- Sorting operations.

## üïπ Current situation:

- Support for Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL).

## üîå To do:

- Add support for MySQL and PostgreSQL.
- Add support for the Paging and Sorting operations.

## ‚ùì How to use:
- Create a new project then add this library by download the jar file from the `Release` tab.
- Or you can clone this repository without having download the jar file.
- `Remember to also add the JDBC driver`.
- For Servlet environment, you can configure like this by creating a 
new class `ServletListener` or the class implementing the `ServletContextListener` interface :

- For non-Servlet environment, navigate to your Main class and configure like this:

## ‚ùóÔ∏è Appendix:
- If you want to show the SQL Query while executing the methods, there is
a `JdbcRepository.DEBUG` variable needed to be set as `true`. Default is `false`.
- You may notice there is a `ConnectionManager` class.
    + This class responsible for getting the `Connection` instance.
    + If you use Data Source way, there is a file `context.xml` in the `META-INF` folder.
    + If you chose the way to create a new `context.xml` file, please 
  set the name of the data source by `JDBCRepository` or the `ConnectionManager` won't initialize your connection pool.
